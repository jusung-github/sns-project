Predicting Daily Stock Prices

i. a brief description of the project.
For this project, I will develop a simple statistical model that can be used to predict a specific stock's price for the next day based on patterns in previous closing prices. 

ii. the algorithm / library / methods that you want to use.
In terms of algorithm, I will use linear regression and moving average. Linear regression will be used to compare the previous closing prices of a stock and the current prices. Historical data will also be used to identify trends and patterns. Moving average will be used to highlight the effect of long term trends and reduce errors from short term fluctuations.

Different libraries will be used, such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. A library for evaluating the accuracy of the prediction should also be used (not decided yet).

iii. any data that you might need.
For this project, I will need the historical stock price data of a few weeks~months on daily closing prices to identify the trend. They can be obtained from financial data providers online. 

iv. the expected outcome.
From this project, a functional model that can predict a stock's closing price for the next day will be made. We can also compare the accuracy of the prediction by comparing it to the actual price.
